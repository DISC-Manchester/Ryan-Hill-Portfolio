						<h3> Testing and maintenance </h3>
						<p>
							If there are bugs or errors in the software, this skill would be helpful
							because they could be found early and fixed before the software was delivered.
							Also I would be using a test plan to document the website's tests.
							A test plan will help me keep track of all the test I have done for the website.

						<h3> Problem solving </h3>
						<p>
							In programming improvement, critical thinking is the most common way of utilizing
							speculations
							and exploration to track down answers for an issue in the software, while testing various
							thoughts
							and applying best practices to accomplish an ideal outcome.

						<h3> Communication </h3>
						<p>
							Communication is integral to software engineering. Effective communication reduces costs,
							increases productivity, saves time, minimizes errors, and develops work cultures.
							Communication enables the sharing of information to achieve software engineering goals.

						<h3> Software documentation </h3>
						<p>
							Information about a software program is provided in software documentation for all parties
							involved in its development,
							deployment, and use. Documentation guides and records the advancement interaction.
							It additionally helps with fundamental errands like establishment and investigating.
							I have used this skill in testing software with a test plan as it is helpful to make sure
							that every feature is working as intended

						<h3> Space Invaders Game Project </h3>
						<p>
							Our Client wanted us to make a 2D game that had at least one character, setting/theme
							and a Objective for the game. Also the game could be any type of game such as platformer,
							shooter, puzzle and visual novel as long as the game was 2D. I choosen a Space invaders game
							as
							it was simple and met the client's brief as we were short on time in making
							the game which was about a month as there were some problems in teaching.
							I programmed this game with arrays, viarables and if statements.
							If statements were used for if the player got hit, if the aliens got to the player,
							if the payer hits the alien then add point or if the player kills all the aliens then he
							wins
							the Viarables were used to state the objects as part of the code so then I could create code
							that
							could generate a certain amount of aliens or bullets or other code words like arreys.
							Also I mainly used arrays for bullets, aliens bullets and the aliens
							as they were things that need to be generated as the program is running

						<h3> My Pong Animation</h3>
						<p>
							the Pong animation was animation set by the client as they wanted an animation
							that was 30 second animation and had to had certain thing to happen like adding motion
							tweens,
							so the animation was smooth all the way through instead of having it jump frame by frame.
							it also had to have keyframes to tell the software were it was going and ending in terms of
							point to point.
