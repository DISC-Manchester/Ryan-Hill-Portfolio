        <h2> What is star wars? </h2>

        <p>


          The Star Wars franchise depicts the adventures of characters "A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away",
          in which humans and many species of aliens (often humanoid) co-exist with robots (typically referred to in the
          films as 'droids'),
          who may assist them in their daily routines; space travel between planets is common due to lightspeed
          hyperspace technology.
          The planets range from wealthy, planet-wide cities to deserts scarcely populated by primitive tribes.
          Virtually any Earth biome, along with many fictional ones, has its counterpart as a Star Wars planet which, in
          most cases, teem with sentient and non-sentient alien life.
          The franchise also makes use of other astronomical objects such as asteroid fields and nebulae.
          Spacecraft range from small starfighters, to huge capital ships such as the Star Destroyers, to space stations
          such as the moon-sized Death Stars. Telecommunication includes
          two-way audio and audiovisual screens, holographic projections, and HoloNet (internet counterpart).


          The universe of Star Wars is generally similar to ours but its laws of physics are less strict allowing for
          more imaginative stories.
          One result of that is a mystical power known as the Force which is described in the original film as "an
          energy field created by all living things ... that binds the galaxy together".
          The field is depicted as a kind of pantheistic god. Through training and meditation, those whom "the Force is
          strong with" are able to perform various superpowers
          (such as telekinesis, precognition, telepathy, and manipulation of physical energy).
          It is believed nothing is impossible for the Force.


          The mentioned powers are wielded by two major knightly orders at conflict with each other:
          the Jedi, peacekeepers of the Galactic Republic who act on the light side of the Force through non-attachment
          and arbitration, and the Sith, who use the dark side by manipulating fear and aggression.
          While Jedi Knights can be numerous, the Dark Lords of the Sith (or 'Darths') are intended to be limited to
          two: a master and their apprentice.
          Force-wielders are very limited in numbers in comparison to the population. The Jedi and Sith prefer the use
          of a weapon called a lightsaber,
          a blade of plasma that can cut through virtually any surface and deflect energy bolts. The rest of the
          population, as well as renegades and soldiers,
          use plasma-powered blaster firearms. As a result of galaxy-scaled politics, all this weaponry is made use of
          in various military conflicts during which most Star Wars material takes place.
          In the outer reaches of the galaxy, crime syndicates such as the Hutt cartel are dominant. Bounty hunters are
          often employed by both gangsters and governments. Illicit activities include smuggling and slavery.
          Planets allowing for countless settings and incredible life variety, technology on various advancement levels,
          and fantasy elements make Star Wars a very universal franchise. Virtually every genre and type of story can be
          adapted
          to fit into the franchise.

        <h2> What is Destiny 2? </h2> </br>

        <br>
        <p>
          Destiny 2 is a free-to-play online first-person shooter video game developed by Bungie.
          It was originally released as a pay to play game in 2017 for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Windows.
          It became free-to-play, utilizing the games as a service model, under the New Light title on October 1, 2019,
          followed by the game's release on Stadia the following month, and then PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S
          platforms
          in December 2020. The game was published by Activision until December 31, 2018, when Bungie acquired
          the publishing rights to the franchise. It is the sequel to 2014's Destiny and its subsequent expansions.

          Set in a "mythic science fiction" world, the game features a multiplayer "shared-world"
          environment with elements of role-playing games. Like the original, activities in Destiny 2 are divided
          among player versus environment (PvE) and player versus player (PvP) game types.
          In addition to normal story missions, PvE features three-player "strikes" and dungeons and six-player raids.
          A free roam patrol mode is also available for each destination which feature public events as well as
          activities
          not available in the original. These activities have an emphasis on exploration of the destinations and
          interactions with non-player characters (NPCs); the original Destiny only featured NPCs in social spaces.
          PvP features objective-based modes, as well as traditional deathmatch game modes.
