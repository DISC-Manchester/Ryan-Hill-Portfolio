        <h2> The challenges I need to overcome when building this website </h2> </br>

        <br>
        <p>
          The challenges that I had to overcome when building this website was fixing bugs like I mistyped a code
          for the 3D flip which ment that the 3D effect wasn't working as it would just flip insantly. I checked the
          code. I also researched to make sure that I was correct and it turned our with my research, I realised
          that I was also missing a bit of code and put in that part of the code to fix it then it worked correctly
          like I wanted it to do. Another challenge that I had to overcome was choosing the right background for the
          requirements as I was planning to using a plan black background before I chosen this star background.The
          reason why I chosen this background was to make the website more visually entertaining instead of having a
          boring black background.
